2. **Flutter Installation:**
   - Download [Flutter SDK](https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/windows/flutter_windows_3.19.6-stable.zip) package, extract it and add ```flutter/bin``` directory to ```PATH```.

3. **Validate flutter installation:**
   - To verify your installation of all the components, run the following command:

     ```bash

     Make sure Flutter and Chrome has green checks.

### [Flutter for Android](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile)

## VS Code

You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) combined with Flutterâ€™s command-line tools, that's why we highly recommend Visual Studio Code.

Using it with with the following extensions provides code completion, syntax highlighting, widget editing assists, debugging, and other features:

- **Flutter**, ID: Dart-Code.flutter
- **Flutter Widget Snippets**, ID: gornivv.vscode-flutter-files
